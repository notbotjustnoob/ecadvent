    "difficulty": "Difficulty A",
    "question": "A thick, infinitely wide and long elastic plate is subjected to a uniform tensile stress. The plate contains a through-thickness elliptical hole.\n\n(1) Give the formula for the stress concentration factor Kt at the ends of the major axis and the minor ellipse.\n(2) Using this result, determine the value of Kt for the special case of a circular hole.",
    "answer": "For an elliptical hole in an infinite plate under tension, the stress concentration factor at the end of the major axis is: Kt = 1 + 2(a/b).\n\nFor a circular hole, a = b, so:\nKt = 1 + 2(a/a) = 3."

    "answer": "Probabilistic ECA is a fracture assessment method where key inputs such as flaw size, material properties, and loading are treated as statistical variables, producing a failure probability.<p>Applications:<p>1. Produce ECA-based acceptance criteria by evaluating the probability of failure (for a defined set of project inputs) and comparing it to standardized target failure probability.<p>2. Define a parameter based on a target reliability/ probability of failure (e.g., DFF in RECIF).<p>3. Support deterministic ECA by quantifying the risk behind a choice of a specif parameter.<p><p>DoE is a structured statistical approach used to plan and analyze tests to understand how multiple factors influence a response while minimizing the number of experiments.<p>Applications:<p>1. Sensitivity studies and possibility frontiers.<p>2. Model definition, calibration and validation."
